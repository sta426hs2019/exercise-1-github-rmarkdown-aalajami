## Exercise 1.b

## Description

HTML document that: samples 100 values from a log-normal distribution, creates a histogram of the distribution and the distribution on the log scale, and also reports the mean and variance of the sample

## This is a R-code chunk

Sampling 100 values from a log-normal distribution with meanlog= 1 and sdlog=0.25

```{r}
samples <- rlnorm(100, 1, 0.25)
```

Plotting the histogram of the distribution and that on the log scale

```{r}
hist(samples)
hist(log(samples))
```

Reporting the mean and variance of the sample

The sample mean is:
```{r}
mean(samples)
```

The sample variance is:
```{r}
var(samples)
```
